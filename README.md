# Perception Stack (GANDIVA)

This repository hosts perception pipelines for robotics,
including computer vision, machine learning, and sensor fusion.

Work here focuses on enabling robots to perceive, detect,
track, and understand their environment, providing inputs
for autonomy and intelligent decision-making.
